A remote-controlled polyhouse project involves creating a controlled environment for plants using a polyethylene greenhouse structure and implementing remote control functionality for managing various parameters such as temperature, humidity, lighting, and irrigation. 
And the purpose of this system is to control the environment of a polyhouse using our phone device or our laptop .
